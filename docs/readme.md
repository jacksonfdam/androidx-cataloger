# Introduction

You know what’s fun?
Scrolling endlessly through [AndroidX Explorer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/explorer), manually checking library versions, release dates, and adding each dependency like it’s some kind of ritual. Even better when you’re dealing with 10+ libraries and can’t remember which ones are already in your catalog. Total bliss.

So yeah — this project was born out of desperation.
I spent the whole week sick at home, with my daughters (11 and 12) also sick and extremely bored. Picture this: Minecraft, Roblox, non-stop screaming, and me trying to survive. I needed a mental escape.

And weirdly enough, this helped.
Now when I’m too lazy to dig through pages or remember the latest version of some AndroidX lib, I just click what I want, and boom — it builds the catalog for me. Full Gradle snippet included. No thinking required. Just blessed automation.

Is it perfect? Nope.
Plenty of room for improvements. But those come with time (and hopefully silence).
Feel free to criticize, collaborate, or fork the thing. Especially if you’re also tired of dealing with this AndroidX mess by hand.

Enjoy (or not).
